/**
 * Rules for the "Traceable build" badge. A release is traceable only when the
 * evidence ties its primary asset to a successful run of the exact managed
 * workflow at the release commit:
 *
 * - the managed workflow file at the tagged commit is byte-identical to the
 *   one BedrockNexus installed (same git blob SHA), so its build and release
 *   steps were not edited;
 * - the run that built the tag succeeded for that same tag and commit;
 * - the GitHub Release and its asset were both created by the workflow token
 *   (`github-actions[bot]`), not uploaded by a person;
 * - the asset was uploaded while that run was executing, so it was not
 *   replaced afterwards (replacing an asset creates a new one).
 *
 * This is build provenance, not a security review of the plugin's code.
